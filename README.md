# DOM-and-Events-Studio
The rocket object moves on the screen according to the buttons that are pushed. The rocket stays within the background. Best played/viewed on a large screen as it has not been scaled.

My contributions were as follows:
Functionality of the buttons
Increase/Decrease of the Shuttle Height by 10000 either way when the button was clicked
Changes in background screen when take off, landing and aborted buttons were pushed
Change of messages and pop ups according to user clicks

In this studio the gui was provided.
